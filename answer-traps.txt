由24,26得main直接计算出了结果并储存
```

Q: 
Run the following code.

	unsigned int i = 0x00646c72;
	printf("H%x Wo%s", 57616, &i);
      
What is the output? Here's an ASCII table that maps bytes to characters.
The output depends on that fact that the RISC-V is little-endian. 
If the RISC-V were instead big-endian what would you set i to in order to yield the same output?
Would you need to change 57616 to a different value?

A:
output: He110,World
0x726c6400
No
```

Q: 
In the following code, what is going to be printed after 'y='? 
  (note: the answer is not a specific value.) Why does this happen?

	printf("x=%d y=%d", 3);

A:
UB: 取决于 a2 之前保存的值
